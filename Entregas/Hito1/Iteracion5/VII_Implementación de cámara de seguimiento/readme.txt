The camera is implemented in the "game" executable.
It is controlled with the player's movement keys (A,D,W,S), and it follows the main player.

In addition and for further range of view, when we place the mouse near an edge of the screen
it will move slightly to its direction.

To exemplify there is a video in the same repository.
