 Source code in ..\GitHub\lab21\Desarrollo\game\src:

 - Main.cpp

 In our game, we have doors that works naturaly, but there are zones where energy doesn't works and you need to activate a generator in order to activate a certain zone. To activate a generator you need a MagnetKey, but only the MagnetKey that belongs to the generator will activate it. You have to search for MagnetKeys in all the places of lab21 and activate generators to access to other zones. 

 To get the MagnetKeys, when you find one, just step into it and you will get it. After that, go to the generator room and try to activate a generator. If the MagnetKey belongs to the generator, it will activate it and with this, the zone that gets energy from the generator.
