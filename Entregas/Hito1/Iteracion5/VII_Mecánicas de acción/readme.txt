The action mechanics are implemented in the "game" executable.
These are the some actions:

- Slow down (for the duck action): 	keep pressed "Key 8"
- Accelerate (for the insuline action): keep pressed "Key 9"
- Restore health: 			go over the health kit
- Pick up gun: 				go over gun object
- Rotate player: 			move "mouse" around the player
- Shoot: 				press left button of the mouse

There are some other actions still in process.

To exemplify there is a video in the same repository.
