Comunicaci칩n simulada b치sica entre NPCs (Blackboard)

Blackboard is what uses the enemies to communicate with each other. Nowadays, our AI  is not implemented at 100% and we took extra time to develop mechanics and other things of the game. As a result, we have one enemy in Alfa. We understood how implement Blackboard, and we know how we want it, but it will be added in the next stages of the game development.
