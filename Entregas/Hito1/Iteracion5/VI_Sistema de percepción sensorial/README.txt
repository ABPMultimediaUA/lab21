The perception system is implemented in the "game" executable.
Use player control keys (A,D,W,S) to move any direction.
Move in silence with LShift key.
The enemy has 2 ratios of hearing, if you get inside of the bigger one running, he will see you.
You can move in silence trough the bigger ratio without getting caught, but the enemy will see you if you get into the small ratio.
There is also a vision field, it moves with the enemy and if you get inside of it, the enemy will see you.
Once the enemy has detected you, he will follow you every way with a pathplanning system.

To exemplify there is a video in the same repository.

You can see the system better in the prototype: ..\GitHub\lab21/Entregas/Hito1/Iteracion4/Perception_.zip
